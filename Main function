Main Function

Main Function 
The main function is a special function. Every C++ program must contain a function named main. It serves as the entry point for the program. The computer will start running the code from the beginning of the main function. 

Types of Main Functions
1. Without parameters:

// Without Parameters
int main() { ... return 0; }
2. With parameters:

// With Parameters
int main(int argc, char* const argv[]) { ... return 0; }

The reason for having the parameter option for the main function is to allow input from the command line. When you use the main function with parameters, it saves every group of characters (separated by a space) after the program name as elements in an array named argv. 
Since the main function has the return type of int, the programmer must always have a return statement in the code. The number that is returned is used to inform the calling program what the result of the programâ€™s execution was. Returning 0 signals that there were no problems
