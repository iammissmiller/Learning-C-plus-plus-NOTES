Use Multiple Loop Variables in for Loop


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  
    // Defining two variable
    int m, n;

    // Loop having multiple variable and updations
    for (m = 1, n = 1; m <= 3; m += 1, n += 2) {
        cout << "iteration " << m << endl;
        cout << "m is: " << m << endl;
        cout << "j is: " << n << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Output
iteration 1
m is: 1
j is: 1
iteration 2
m is: 2
j is: 3
iteration 3
m is: 3
j is: 5


Explanation: The above program uses for loop with multiple variables (here m and n). It increments and updates both variables in each iteration and prints their respective values.
