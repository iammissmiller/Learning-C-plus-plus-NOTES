Points to Remember About Functions in C++

1. Most C++ program has a function called main() that is called by the operating system when a user runs the program. 

2. Every function has a return type. If a function doesn’t return any value, then void is used as a return type. Moreover, if the return type of the function is void, we still can use the return statement in the body of the function definition by not specifying any constant, variable, etc. with it, by only mentioning the ‘return;’ statement which would symbolize the termination of the function as shown below: 


void function name(int a)
{
    ....... // Function Body
        return; // Function execution would get terminated
}


3. To declare a function that can only be called without any parameter, we should use “void fun(void)“. As a side note, in C++, an empty list means a function can only be called without any parameter. In C++, both void fun() and void fun(void) are same.
